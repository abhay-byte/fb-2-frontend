- Added CPU affinity to pin single-core benchmarks to the last (largest) CPU core
- All 10 single-core benchmarks now target the highest-performance core (typically CPU7 on 8-core devices)
- Improved single-core benchmark consistency and performance
- Added setLastCoreAffinity() method to CpuAffinityManager for core targeting
