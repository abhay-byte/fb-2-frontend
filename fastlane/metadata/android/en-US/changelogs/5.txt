v0.5

Performance Improvements:
- Optimized matrix multiplication for better multicore scaling (350% → 750% CPU utilization)
- Added thermal stabilization delays between benchmarks to prevent throttling

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed memory allocation bottleneck in matrix multiplication algorithm
- Adjusted JSON parsing iterations for consistent test duration across device tiers
