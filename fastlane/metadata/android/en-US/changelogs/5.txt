v0.5

Performance Improvements:
- Optimized matrix multiplication for better multicore scaling (350% → 750% CPU utilization)
- Added thermal stabilization delays between benchmarks to prevent throttling

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed memory allocation bottleneck in matrix multiplication algorithm
- Adjusted JSON parsing iterations for consistent test duration across device tiers
- Fixed delete functionality for history benchmarks (now properly deletes from database)
- Consolidated ResultScreen to handle both fresh and history benchmark results
- Fixed CPU comparison screen to display scores in points instead of raw Mops/s
- Resolved self-comparison issue showing incorrect huge values
- Fixed Prime Generation documentation to match actual Pollard's Rho implementation
- Corrected workload parameter inconsistencies across documentation files

Code Quality:
- Centralized SCORING_FACTORS to KotlinBenchmarkManager (single source of truth)
- Removed duplicate HistoryDetailScreen (now uses ResultScreen for all results)
- Refactored CpuComparisonScreen to use centralized scoring factors
- Fixed data format conversions between ops/s and Mops/s across all comparison paths

New Features:
- Added "Baseline" tag to reference device (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3)
- Updated ranking data with latest benchmark results
- Added 2 new reference devices: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 and MediaTek Dimensity 6300
- Created comprehensive documentation for adding reference devices

CPU Benchmark Improvements:
- Updated reference Mops values based on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 results
- Adjusted scoring factors for Monte Carlo and JSON Parsing benchmarks
- Systematized workload tier configurations (mid=0.5×flagship, slow=0.25×mid, test=0.1×slow)
- Increased test workload parameters for better JIT warm-up

Documentation Updates:
- Fixed algorithm documentation for Fibonacci (Polynomial Evaluation) and Hash Computing (SHA-256-like)
- Updated all workload parameters in BENCHMARKS.md to match code
- Verified and corrected all reference Mops values and scoring factors in SCORING.md
- Updated OVERVIEW.md with new algorithm descriptions
